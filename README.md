# food-delivery
"Online Food Ordering System," a V Sem DBMS Lab project. This database-driven app lets customers browse menus, place orders, and track status in real-time. An admin panel allows staff to manage menu items (CRUD) and process incoming orders. The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JS, designed to work with a backend (Python/Node) and SQL database.
